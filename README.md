This is an unfinished TODO list app.

The backend is finished, while the frontend lacks the login page and other components.

Everything about frontend is in /src/frontend.


Branching should be by features:

- branch: feature1 (means that feature1 should be completed in this branch)
- branch: feature2 (means that feature2 should be completed in this branch)

Then merge back to main one by one.
